## Workflow

1. Register a shortcut, e.g. Win-w to call `srst-clips-activate`
2. Start the program and "Find window" with ChatGPT Chrome tab.
   If you read your book in google docs, make it a separate window.
3. Start reading text: first select individual words, then the whole sentence.
4. Finally press Win-w to activate the program, it'll refocus into ChatGPT and will
   make a prompt and press Enter to send it.
